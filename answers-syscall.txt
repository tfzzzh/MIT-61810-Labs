I Using gdb

1.  Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall
A: usertrap() at kernel/trap.c calls the function.

2. What is the value of p->trapframe->a7.  what does that value represent?
A: Its value is 0x7. It means that the process is going to jump into the SYS_exec syscall.

3. What was the previous mode that the CPU was in? 
A: The CPU is in supervisor mode

4.  Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable
num?
A:The instruction causing the panic is "lw	a3,0(zero)". Thus the register a3 corresponds to the variable num.

5. Why does the kernel crash?
A:The kernel space is mapped starting from 0x80000000. And the address 0x00000000 is not in this range.

6.  Is that confirmed by the value in scause
A:Yes. The value 0xd means “load access fault”, which is caused by access invalid memory address 0x0.

7. What is the name of the process that was running when the kernel paniced?
A: "initcode"

8. What is its pid?
A: 1

III Attack xv6
Change the 32 to 0 and you should see that your attack doesn't work anymore; why not? 
Since now the secret string locates the first byte of the target page, not the 32-th byte anymore.
