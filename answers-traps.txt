1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf? 
A: RISCV use register a0-7 to pass arguments. When main calls printf,
the parameter 13 is stored in a2

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.) 
A: The compiler optimize the call by directly compute f(8) + 1. Its result
directly passed to the function printf. And thus in the assemble code, the
function f is not called.

3. At what address is the function printf located? 
A: the function is located at 0x00000000000006bc

4.What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main? 
A: According to the riscv mannual, the jalr stores return address in rd, not ra.
The value of rd is 0x34 after jalr to printf.

5. Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, (char *) &i);
      

What is the output
Q. HE110 World


6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
      
I think it will print value in register a2
